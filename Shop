Connected to the remote port.
While playing around with the values I noticed that one can purchase any amount of a particular thing, as long as they have the coins to buy one
of it and as long as its greater than or equal to the quantity of the product available. The number of coins would just become negative.
So I tried giving negative numbers as input for quantity to be purchased, and it worked, got sufficient coins to purchase the flag.
Got the flag as an array of numbers which i figured out were ascii numbers of letters.
Wrote the following python code to decode it:

line = ""
a = [112, 105, 99, 111, 67, 84, 70, 123, 98, 52, 100, 95, 98, 114, 111, 103, 114, 97, 109, 109, 101, 114, 95, 57, 99, 49, 49, 56, 98, 98, 102, 125]
for i in a:
    
    print(chr(i), end="")
