This level uses the concepts of Visual Cryptography.
To solve this I used a program similar to photoshop called clip studio paint.
Layered the 2 images above each other.
Set the blending mode of the top layer to "hard mix" so that its transparent pixels are viewed as transparent.
Added a layer with black colour and adjusted its opacity until the flag was clear.
