Opened the powerpoint file on powerpoint.
Found nothing but "Not the flag" text on the 37th slide.
Read that converting a ppt file to a zip file and then unzipping it helps analyse it. 
So used wget to get the file on the webshell.
Renamed the file to ppt.zip using mv 
Unzipped using unzip command.
Went through all files in all directories using : for i in $(ls); do file ./$i ; done;
Found a file named 'hidden' under the slidesMaster directory.
After displaying the file the text looked like base64 coded.
Thus wrote the following command to decode it(-d) ignoring the non letter characters(-i):
Obtain the flag.
